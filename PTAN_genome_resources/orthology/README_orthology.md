# Orthology Inference

This directory contains the results of orthogroup and orthologue inference generated by **OrthoFinder v2.5.5** (Emms & Kelly, 2019).  
Analyses were conducted using predicted protein sequences from *Pterospora andromedea*, *Monotropa hypopitys*, *Camellia sinensis*, and *Vaccinium corymbosum* to identify conserved, single-copy, and lineage-specific orthogroups.

Phylogenetic reconstruction was based on concatenated single-copy orthologues, with the species tree rooted using *Camellia sinensis* as the outgroup.

| `Orthologues/` | Pairwise orthologue tables centered on *Pterospora andromedea* |
| `Putative_Xenologs/` | Empty summary tables—no xenologs were detected in this analysis |
| `Species_Tree/` | Rooted species tree derived from single-copy orthologues |
| `README_orthology.md` | This file |

## Notes

- OrthoFinder automatically identified and rooted the species tree using *Camellia sinensis* as the outgroup.
- Input protein sets were filtered for completeness using BUSCO prior to orthology inference.
- Orthogroups were cross-validated using reciprocal best-hit (RBH) BLASTp searches for enzyme-encoding loci.
- Large intermediate directories (`Orthogroup_Sequences/`, `Resolved_Gene_Trees/`) were omitted due to file volume but can be regenerated from these summary outputs.
- All results correspond to OrthoFinder **v2.5.5 default parameters**.
